# PacMen

### Description
A simple program that can create unlimited pacmen and add to the screen with random position, direction, and speed. They bounce off the four walls.  

### How to Run

### Roadmap
- This can be upgraded to detect collisions between pacmen and when that happens they will bounce away from each other. 
- Another upgrade is to add some objects at random positions that pacmen will collide with.
